# GAD Coding Principles
See the principles *[HERE](https://gadhub.github.io/coding_principles_book/)*.

## What is this?
This repository contains a set of R markdown documents which, when rendered produce a bookdown site.

This book is a fork of [DHSC coding principles book](https://github.com/DataS-DHSC/coding_principles_book).

The site contains a set of 10 principles, targeted at the GAD analytical community, with the aim of raising coding standards across the department. These are based on the [MOJ prinicples](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/our-coding-standards).

## Ownership
The GAD Coding Principles are maintained by the AST development team, who sit within the GAD.
